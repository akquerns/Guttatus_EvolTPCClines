# Guttatus_EvolTPCClines
This project contains the pertinent codes used for the project "The Evolution of Thermal Tolerance and Clines in Native and Invasive Populations of Mimulus guttatus"

Please follow the scripts in numbered order

Brief overview of raw data:

guttatus_worldclim_seed_collections-- shows bioclimatic data taken from WorldClim v.2 for ALL available populations (used for PCA)

1-17bioclim_pops-- shows bioclimatic data taken from WorldClim v.2 for ONLY the population selected for thermal performance experiments (post-PCA); includes column "ID3" in which populations have been renamed in order of increasing latitude

ExampleClines-- example cline data used for cartoons of clines hypotheses (see: 2_Maps-and-cartoons)

Rawdata-- Raw data generated from thermal performance experiments; used to create RGR data (see Processed-data/RGRcalcs), which was then used to fuel the Bayesian model
