Column,Data-type,Description
Round,Character,Numbered 1-5; separate occurences of chamber use which happened between 8/2019 and 1/2020
Population,Character,"Original population code--created prior to selecting populations for use in thermal performance experiments. ""I"" indicates invasive UK, and ""N"" incidates native North America."
Family,Character,Original family code--created prior to selecting populations for use in thermal performance experiments. Numbered 35-326.
Replicate,Numeric,"Indicates the numbered replicate cutting of each family taken within a round of chamber use. Within each round, two replicate cuttings were subjected to one of three temperature treatments (i.e. 0.01+0.02 were subjected to temp. A, 0.03+0.04 to temp. B, and 0.05+0.06 to temp. C)"
daytemp,Numeric,The 16-hour daytime temperature treatment
nighttemp,Numeric,The 8 hour nighttime temperature treatment
StemIN,Numeric,The length (cm) of the primary stem of a replicate cutting prior to being subjected to a temperature treatment (but after receiving a 2-week establishment period)
StemOUT,Numeric,The length (cm) of the primary stem of a replicate cutting after to being subjected to a week long temperature treatment 
secondarytotIN,Numeric,"The total number of secondary branches (including both side branches and stolons) counted after a 2-week establishment period, but prior to being subjected to a temperature treatment"
secondarytotOUT,Numeric,The total number of secondary branches (including both side branches and stolons) counted after being subjected to a week long temperature treatment
AvgsecondaryIN,Numeric,"The length (cm) of an average secondary branch (either side branch or stolon) measured after a 2-week establishment period, but prior to being subjected to a temperature treatment"
AvgsecondaryOUT,Numeric,The length (cm) of an average secondary branch (either side branch or stolon) measured after being subjected to a temperature treatment
TotIN_Sub,Numeric,"The total amount of stem growth (cm) measured after a 2-week establishment period, but prior to being subjected to a temperature treatment. (StemIN + (secondarytotIN*AvgsecondaryIN))"
TotOUT_Sub,Numeric,The total amount of stem growth (cm) measured after being subjected to a temperature treatment. (StemOUT + (secondarytotOUT*AvgsecondaryOUT))
RGRTOT1,Numeric,The stem relative growth rate (cm/cm*day) of a replicate cutting during a temperature treatment. ((StemOUT-StemIN)/(StemIN*7))
RGRTOT1x,Numeric,"The stem relative growth rate (cm/cm*day) of a replicate cutting during a temperature treatment, where negative growth rate values (wilted cuttings) have been corrected to zero. ((StemOUT-StemIN)/(StemIN*7)), RGRTOT1x < 0 = 0."
